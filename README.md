# Google Summer of Code 2024: Traffic Management for Dubbo-go and Dubbo-k8s - Feature Enhancement and Demonstration

### Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to improve and enhance the traffic management capabilities of Dubbo. This involves adding more comprehensive routing functionality to Dubbo-go, extending traffic control support in Dubbo-k8s, introducing service mesh traffic management capabilities to Dubbo, and integrating an xDS configuration module.

### My Contributions (Pull Requests)
1. **Script-based Routing in Dubbo-go**: Implemented a new feature that allows the construction of routing rules based on scripts within Dubbo-go.
2. **Upgraded Conditional Routing in Dubbo-go**: Enhanced the existing conditional routing feature in Dubbo-go to offer more sophisticated and flexible routing conditions.
3. **Configuration and Implementation in Dubbo-k8s Admin Section**: Developed the configuration settings and implemented the writing mechanism for the admin section of Dubbo-k8s.
4. **Scenario-based Configuration for Applications, Services, and Instances in Dubbo-k8s**: Designed and implemented scenario-based configuration settings for applications, services, and instances within the admin section of Dubbo-k8s.
5. **xDS Module Integration in Dubbo-k8s**: Introduced the xDS module in Dubbo-k8s by integrating virtual service and destination rule functionalities, enabling the generation of xDS protocol data from traffic management rules.
